# Streamlit App 
## Publish a Neural Network Model using Streamlit


* Dataset is collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection)

* [Sarcasem Detection Model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdulbasitniazi/word2vec-glove-a-beginner-s-guide) is developed using word2vec, LSTM and GRU 

* Instructions for the streamlit app can be found [here](https://heartbeat.comet.ml/sentiment-analysis-with-python-and-streamlit-806c840906bc)

### Some more commands

* Use [pip freeze](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_freeze/) to generate requirements.txt

* [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.com/) has been used to upload model.h5
